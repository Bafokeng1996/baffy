		<h1>EDUCATE</h1>
		<p>A great teacher should love educating students, and one of the principal goals I set for myself 
		is to be the best educator there can be. There is
		something extremely gratifying about imparting information to your students and working 
		with them to ensure they understand, not only concepts,
		but practical applications as well. 
		</p>
		<br /><br />
		<h1> INSPIRE</h1>
		<p>I seek to inspire students in all aspects of their lives. My greatest goal is to be a role model. 
		A role model is someone who inspires and encourages students to strive for greatness, and teaches 
		them through experience and commitment how to realize their full potential to become the best they can be. 
		I can inspire an uninterested student to become engrossed in learning.
