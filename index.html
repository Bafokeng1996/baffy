		<p>I am so excited to be working with students and really making a difference
		  in their lives.Being a lecturer is who I am and what I have always wanted to be.</p>
		<p>I remember being so upset in a class as a child because I did not understand what
		  was being talked about in the classroom. A dedicated teacher helped me by 
		  recognizing my learning disability and finding ways to assist me. I owe my success
		  to this amazing teacher who changed my life.</p>
		<p>Those experiences made me who I am today and I am now helping others. I assist
		students, making the transition to our school systems here in Limkokwing 
		academically . I love my job and am very proud to be in this position making a 
		difference.</p>

      <h1>MY FAVOURITE COURSES</h1>
      <p>The love i have for this courses is beyond describable. This courses made me 
	  to realise that whatever you persist on doing gets easier to do, not that the nature
	  of a thing has changed but the ability of doing it has increased</p>
